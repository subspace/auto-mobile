# Auto SDK Examples

This directory contains examples of how to use the Auto SDK.

These examples are to run in the NodeJS runtime environment. But, as this monorepo is a react-native project, so we need to run the examples in a react-native environment.

As of last time, the examples used to be run using `yarn` with the given scripts as set in [`package.json`](https://github.com/subspace/auto-sdk-ts/blob/6d44565dd814077501e3481b612f541c5ac93af5/package.json). To run the same, you need to checkout [commit](https://github.com/subspace/auto-sdk-ts/commit/6d44565dd814077501e3481b612f541c5ac93af5).
